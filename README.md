# Real-Time Iterations for Bilevel Optimization With Application to Locomotion Gait Generation
Code for online gait generation using real time iterations for bilevel optimization.

The code contained here is an implementation of the algorithm presented in the associated paper (link pending).

Please note that the code is rough and needs improvements before it can be used by others, 
but it is nonetheless made public so others can see the implementation details.
